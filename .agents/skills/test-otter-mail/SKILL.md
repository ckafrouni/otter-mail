description: Test Otter Mail's UI and behavior in T3's built-in Browser panel against the seeded demo mailbox (`pnpm dev:demo`), with no Google, Gmail or Otter account. Use for browser verification of any change to the renderer (apps/web) or the mail backend (packages/core).

# Test Otter Mail on the demo mailbox

Use T3's built-in Browser panel (the `preview_*` tools) for verification. If
its tools are absent or the panel reports unavailable, explain the blocker and
stop verification. Do not install or switch to another automation system.

Test against the demo mailbox, never the user's real accounts: don't sign in
to Google or Otter, and don't use `pnpm dev` (the relay and real sign-ins) for
testing unless the change is about sign-in or the relay itself.

## Start the app

Reuse this task's healthy `pnpm dev:demo` server. Otherwise run `pnpm dev:demo`
from the repository root (or the "Dev (demo mailbox)" script in `t3.json`) and
keep its terminal session. Read the URL from its first line
(`[dev] http://localhost:<port>`): 5833 in the main checkout, another port in a
linked worktree or when 5833 is busy. The page title ends in "(demo)".

## What's in it

Two mailboxes under "All mailboxes": Personal (`demo@otter.example`) and Work
(`sam@acme.example`). A few weeks of mail: multi-message threads, newsletters
with unsubscribe, PDF/SVG/CSV attachments, calendar invitations (RSVP),
drafts, spam, trash, nested labels (`Projects/Otter`), non-ASCII names.
The seed is `apps/web/src/web/demo/seed.ts`; add to it when a flow needs
mail it doesn't have.

A pretend Gmail (`apps/web/src/web/demo/gmail.ts`) answers the backend: archive,
labels, stars, trash, send and drafts change it and its history feed, so sync
behaves as with Gmail. Search supports the common operators and free text.
Not available: the Otter account (sign-in, devices, synced preferences), Google
Calendar (RSVPs go out as email replies), contact photos, new mail arriving on
its own, and Mac-only features (`features` in the web bridge).

## Use the Browser panel

Call `preview_status`, then `preview_open` if the Browser panel is closed.
Always test at a 1600x1000 viewport: `preview_resize` with
`{mode:"freeform",width:1600,height:1000}` before looking at anything (a
headless browser from the shell uses the same size).
Navigate to the dev server URL with `preview_navigate`, then use
`preview_snapshot` and T3's interaction tools. `preview_evaluate` can call the
backend directly, e.g.
`window.desktopBridge.invoke("gmail:listAccounts")`. Keep using the same tab.

## Reset

The demo's state survives reloads (its own OPFS storage, apart from real mail
on the same origin). To start over, close other tabs of the app and navigate
to the URL with `?reset-demo` appended. Don't clear site data: that would also
wipe a real dev sign-in on the same origin.

## Verify and retain

Exercise the affected flow and capture the state that proves it works; check
the console for errors. Keep the server and panel available while the user
inspects or iterates. An assistant turn ending is not teardown. Stop only
processes you started.
